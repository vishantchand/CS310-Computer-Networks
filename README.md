# CS310 – Computer Networks

**Description:**  
This repository contains assignments and projects for **CS310 – Computer Networks**, showcasing skills in network design, IP addressing, routing, LAN/WAN setup, and network simulation using tools like **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

---

## Overview

This project documents the detailed network design, IP addressing, subnetting calculations, and configuration files for the **MediConnect Supermarket Network**, completed as part of **CS310 Assignment 2 (Group 6)**. The main objectives are to demonstrate practical application of:

- **Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)**  
- **RIP v2 routing**  
- **DHCP configuration**  
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  

---

## Contents

- **Subnetting Calculations (VLSM):** For Wi-Fi, CCTV, and Point-of-Sale (POS) devices.  
- **IP Addressing Plan:** Summary of subnets, usable IP ranges, and subnet masks.  
- **Network Topology:** Diagram showing physical and logical connections.  
- **Router Configurations:**  
  - Suva Router  
  - Savusavu Router  
- **DHCP Configurations:** For Wi-Fi networks.  
- **RIP v2 Routing Configurations:** For both routers.  
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** To enforce network security and segmentation.  
- **Connectivity Checklists:** Verifying end-to-end connectivity for all devices.  
- **Conclusion:** Summary of project outcomes and results.  
- **Student Contributions:** Individual work accountability for group members.

## Key Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Efficient **IP address allocation** using VLSM.  
- Configuring **routers for inter-subnet routing** using RIP v2.  
- Implementing **DHCP** for dynamic IP assignment.  
- Applying **ACLs** to enforce network security policies.  
- Documenting and testing a **multi-subnet network environment**.
