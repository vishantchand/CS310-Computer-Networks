# CS310-Computer-Networks
Assignments and projects for CS310 – Computer Networks, demonstrating knowledge in network design, IP addressing, routing, LAN/WAN setup, and network simulation using tools like Cisco Packet Tracer.

Overview

This repository contains the detailed network design, IP addressing, subnetting calculations, and configuration files for the MediConnect supermarket network, completed as part of CS310 – Computer Networks (Assignment 2, Group 6). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM), RIP v2 routing, DHCP configuration, and Access Control Lists (ACLs) in a real-world scenario.

Contents

Subnetting Calculations (VLSM) for Wi-Fi, CCTV, and Point-of-Sale (POS) devices

IP Addressing Plan summarizing subnets, usable IP ranges, and subnet masks
